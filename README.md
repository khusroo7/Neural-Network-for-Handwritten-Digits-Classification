# Neural-Network-for-Handwritten-Digits-Classification
An image is provided as input, and the model's output layer consists of 10 classes, representing digits from 0 to 9.
<br>
The objective is to classify the input image into one of these digit classes.
<br>
The neural network is designed with multiple hidden layers to process the input data.
<br>
The performance of the model is evaluated by calculating its accuracy, which indicates how effectively the model classifies the digits.
<br>
The sigmoid activation function is used, as it outputs values between 0 and 1.
<br>
The loss function employed is sparse_categorical_crossentropy, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
